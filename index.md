## The Problem With Anti-Cheats
Hello, I am a gamer and I enjoy games such as Rainbow Six Siege, Human Fall Flat, PAYDAY 2 and more. The problem with these games, is not the game itself but the cheaters on the game. Most games use 'the golden standard' anti-cheats such as BE (BattlEye), EAC (EasyAntiCheat) and more. Meanwhile games with these anti-cheats are famous for cheaters. 

### My Experience With Anti-Cheats
So far, my experience with anti-cheats has been pretty horrible. I've encountered games 'protected' by anti-cheats such as VAC, BattlEye and more where every lobby you connect to, there is always a guy with blatant cheats or the guy trying to look legit while cheating. They also have a high chance of banning you, which once happened to be with BattlEye over a misunderstanding. For more information about this 'misunderstanding', please take a look at : https://paste.sh/x7H3e-QI#GOdYyK7yqNbPXGXa5pQGlNB0 I will not be including it here since basically nobody cares.

## Horrible Anti-Cheats

### VAC
VAC, Valve Anti-Cheat has to be one of the worst anti-cheats to ever exist. This anti-cheat is so bad, literally free cheats out there exist that bypass the anti-cheat for over 2 years. Even if a cheat was detected, there are still a LOT of ways for making it undetectable again quickly. The only way you can get banned in games that use VAC is through manual reviews. I refuse to believe VAC is real and not some joke.

### HackShield
HackShield is pretty bad. Thank god barely any games use it, this anti-cheat can somehow get worser than VAC. The source code was leaked around in 2010 and publicly released here. https://www104.zippyshare.com/v/MK262NAS/file.html, and there are bypasses on Github from August 2020, that still work. https://github.com/st4ckh0und/HackShield-bypass, I don't even care about this anti-cheat as basically only 2 games I'm aware of use it. There is even an entire threads showcasing how garbage it is at

### Warden
I won't even explain. This is the anti-cheat for Overwatch, I remember wanting to buy this game because everyone was talking about. Didn't even bother to take a look at the game's trailer or know what it is because I've been seeing cheats for this game everywhere. This sadly looks like a case of good game but a lot of cheaters.

### RICOCHET Anti-Cheat 
This is the anti-cheat that COD Warzone will use to stop the cheating problem, this plan has failed horribly. The kernel driver for the anti-cheat already got leaked and is being reversed, people can easy de-obfuscate it in an hour so cheat developers can get the information they need and it's likely that there will be Day 1 cheats. This is a horrible anti-cheat.

## Good Examples of Anti-Cheats

### Riot VanGuard
Riot VanGuard is a very good showcase of a good anti-cheat, they are the best out there. This anti-cheat proved that good anti-cheats can exist.
